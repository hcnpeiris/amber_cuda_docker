# Amber24 and AmberTools25 with CUDA - Docker Build

This repository provides a simple `Dockerfile` to help you easily build and run Amber24 and AmberTools25 with CUDA support in a Docker container.

**Why use this?** 
Installing CUDA, its dependencies, and other scientific software on Linux can be complicated and often leads to compatibility problems. This Docker image solves that by putting everything you need into lightweight, isolated environment. For calculations that use your GPU (like Amber's `pmemd.cuda`), performance is generally not affected when running inside Docker, as it directly uses your GPU. This is different from CPU-heavy software, where both your main system and the Docker container might compete for CPU power.

**Important Note:** 
Due to licensing restrictions, the Amber24 source code **cannot be distributed** with this repository. Users are required to obtain their own licensed copies.

## Requirements

- Amber24 and AmberTools25 source code  
  [Download from official Amber website](https://ambermd.org/GetAmber.php)
- Docker installed  
  [Install Docker on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- NVIDIA GPU with drivers  
  [Install NVIDIA Drivers on Ubuntu](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/graphics/install-nvidia-drivers/index.html)
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit  
  [Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hcnpeiris/amber_cuda_docker.git
   cd amber_cuda_docker
   ```

2. Move the AmberTools25 and Amber24 source archives into this directory, then extract them.  
   This will create `ambertools25_src` and `pmemd24_src` directories:

   ```bash
   tar xvfj ambertools25.tar.bz2
   tar xvfj pmemd24.tar.bz2
   ```

3. Enable CUDA support in both build scripts:  
   - Open `ambertools25_src/build/run_cmake` and change `DCUDA=False` to `DCUDA=TRUE`  
   - Open `pmemd24_src/build/run_cmake` and change `DCUDA=False` to `DCUDA=TRUE`

## Build the Image

```bash
sudo docker build -t amber_cuda .
```

## Run the Container

```bash
sudo docker run --gpus all -it amber_cuda
```

## Notes

- No need to manually install any dependencies â€” everything is handled during the Docker image build process.
- **Be mindful of disk space:** Both the Docker image itself and Amber's output files can consume significant storage. Ensure you have sufficient disk space available on your system.
